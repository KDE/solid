 * This class represents an asynchronous job performed by Solid,

 * other class, for example \See AcPluggedJob or \See StatesJob
 *
 * There are two ways of using this class, one is via exec() which will block
 * the thread until a result is fetched, the other is via connecting to the
 * signal result()
 *
 * Please, think twice before using exec(), it should be used only in either
 * unittest or cli apps.
 *
 * @note Job and its subclasses are meant to be used
 * in a fire-and-forget way. Jobs will delete themselves
 * when they finish using deleteLater()
 *
 * @note Even given their asynchronous nature, Jobs are still executed in the
 * main thread, so any blocking code executed in it will block the app calling it.
